   - **`pages/`**: Houses the Next.js pages, including `index.tsx`, `grantstome.tsx`, and others.
   - **`types/`**: Likely contains TypeScript type definitions.
   - **`components/`**: Contains reusable UI components, such as those for authorization and wallet management.
   - **`node_modules/`**: Contains installed npm packages.
   - **`utils/`**: Utility functions and helpers.
   - **`src/`**: May contain source code, though its specific contents are not listed.
   - **`styles/`**: Contains CSS or styling files.
   - **`scripts/`**: Contains scripts for build or deployment tasks.
   - **`public/`**: Static files like images or fonts.
   - **`proto/`**: Likely contains protocol buffer files or related resources.
   - **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks for managing state and side effects.
   - **`configs/`**: Configuration files for the application.
   - **`context/`**: Context providers for managing global state.

2. **Files**:
   - **`features.md`**: Documentation of the project's features.
