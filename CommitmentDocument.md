**Submitted by:** Harrison Eze & Team  
**Submission Round:** Round 7 

---

## 🔍 Project Summary

**Delegated Staking Agent (DSA)** is a decentralized application that allows users in the Cosmos ecosystem to securely delegate staking and governance permissions using the Cosmos SDK’s **Authz module**. It enables non-custodial control over staking operations while adding support for a privacy-enhanced assistant via **Secret AI SDK** to guide users through permissions, expiration, and grant actions.

The platform is live on [testnet](https://dsa-snowy.vercel.app/) with core features and will evolve into a full-feature mainnet app with community-wide onboarding and governance tooling.
