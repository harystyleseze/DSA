# Delegated Staking Agent (DSA) - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The Delegated Staking Agent (DSA) is an innovative decentralized application built on the Cosmos ecosystem that revolutionizes the way users manage their staking operations. By leveraging the Cosmos SDK's Authz module, DSA enables secure delegation of staking activities without transferring asset ownership, creating a trustless environment for delegation management.

### Core Value Proposition

DSA addresses several key challenges in the Cosmos ecosystem:

- Complex staking management for large token holders
- Need for professional delegation services without asset custody
- Governance participation optimization
- Risk management in staking operations

### Impacts

- Financial Inclusion and Accessibility: Many in Africa are excluded from traditional financial systems due to high transaction fees, poor banking infrastructure, and limited access to global financial products. DSA provides a decentralized, borderless financial system, allowing users to participate in staking and earn rewards without needing a bank account.

- Governance and Empowerment: Many African nations seek more inclusive, transparent, and decentralized governance in financial systems. DSA enables users to participate in decentralized governance, giving them a voice in important decisions without relying on centralized authorities.

- Cross-Border Transactions: Cross-border transactions within Africa are often costly, slow, and complicated due to currency issues and limited banking infrastructure. DSA enables fast, low-cost, and borderless cross-chain transactions, allowing users to easily interact with the global crypto ecosystem.

```

## Technical Implementation

### Authorization System

The grant system implements four primary authorization types:

```typescript
enum PermissionId {
  SEND = "send",
  DELEGATE = "delegate",
  VOTE = "vote",
  CLAIM_REWARDS = "claim-rewards",
}

interface GrantMsg {
  grantType: PermissionId;
  customize?: {
    spendLimit?: Coin[];
    maxTokens?: Coin;
    allowList?: { address: string[] };
    denyList?: { address: string[] };
    authorizationType?: AuthorizationType;
  };
}
```

### Grant Creation Flow

1. **User Input Collection**

   ```typescript
   interface GrantCreation {
     grantee: string;
     expiration: Date;
     permission: PermissionItem;
     limits?: {
       send?: number;
       delegate?: number;
     };
     accessList?: {
       type: "allowList" | "denyList";
       addresses: string[];
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Validation & Processing**
   - Address format validation
   - Chain-specific parameter validation
   - Expiration date verification
   - Limit amount validation
